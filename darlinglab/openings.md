We are always seeking people who are passionate about using computational and statistical methods to help unravel the forces of genome evolution. The Darling lab at UTS is located in the ithree institute, in close proximity with many people who are experts in microbiology, creating a fertile cross-disciplinary environment.

#### Postdoctoral Research Associate
Currently there is an opportunity for a postdoctoral research associate to join the group to investigate computational and statistical methods for inference of evolutionary history and genetic structure of microbial communities from streaming data sets. Possible lines of research include development of Approximate Bayesian techniques, Variational Bayesian methods, or Sequential Monte Carlo methods.

#### Ph.D. fellowships
An opportunity exists for a Ph.D. student to investigate the evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance linked with plasmids and integrons. This could involve learning and developing new molecular and computational inference methods.

Interested? [Contact Aaron](/people).
